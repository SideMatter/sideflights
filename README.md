### What do I need to do if I’m planning on going?

> Firstly, be in the LTX Meetup Planning discord, as that will be the easiest way to communicate information regarding the event. If you’re not in the discord, then this site isn’t gonna help you much. Secondly, acquire transportation, lodging, and optionally, an LTX ticket. Also have some flex money that’s able to be spent in Canada for food and such.

## Flights

### How do I find the best flights

> Two ways:\
> &#x20;If you’d rather find and book your own flights, then you can do that and just notify SideMatter#0001 on the LTX discord with your plans. I (SideMatter) just need your Itinerary for flights (Departing airport, airline, flight code, layover airports, times and timezones for each leg, etc) Feel free to DM me that info. In accordance with sidematter industries privacy policy, it will only be used to create the graphs in the discord (and maybe posted here with consent) The site I use is called https://skiplagged.com\
> If you’d rather not think about it and have me find your flights, simply send me your departing airport and preferences (what airlines you like, window middle or aisle seat etc) I will start tracking prices and notify you when it gets to a reasonable price. I’ll also add it to the tracking graphs, so you can get a glimpse of how the price changes over time. \
> If you choose to book, let me know when, and i’ll lock you in on the various graphs
