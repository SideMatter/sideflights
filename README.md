Heyo! If you are here your probably looking for information regarding the top secret LTX 2023 meetup. This page will serve as a spot for me to put all the FAQs regarding the meetup. The docs are located at [this link ](https://github.com/SideMatter/sideflights)so feel free to make a PR

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this?

> This is a website for LTX Planning and coordiantion.

### Who is this site for?

> dbrand dipshits going to LTX23 . If that’s not you, you're in the wrong place

### What is LTX?

> LTX (or also known as Linus Tech Expo) is an event put on by Linus Media Group, in Vancouver BC. While LTX is the one of the reasons why we are going, it’s not the main one. The main one is to meet up with some fellow dipshits (and other affiliated parties) and hang out.

### When is this?

> LTX is July 28 and 29th however, we are planning a week up there, so dates would be the 26th through the 2nd

### What do I need to do if I’m planning on going?

> Firstly, be in the LTX Meetup Planning discord, as that will be the easiest way to communicate information regarding the event. If you’re not in the discord, then this site isn’t gonna help you much. Secondly, acquire transportation, lodging, and optionally, an LTX ticket. Also have some flex money that’s able to be spent in Canada for food and such.

## Flights

### How do I find the best flights

> Two ways:\
> &#x20;If you’d rather find and book your own flights, then you can do that and just notify SideMatter#0001 on the LTX discord with your plans. I (SideMatter) just need your Itinerary for flights (Departing airport, airline, flight code, layover airports, times and timezones for each leg, etc) Feel free to DM me that info. In accordance with sidematter industries privacy policy, it will only be used to create the graphs in the discord (and maybe posted here with consent) The site I use is called [skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com)\
> If you’d rather not think about it and have me find your flights, simply send me your departing airport and preferences (what airlines you like, window middle or aisle seat etc) I will start tracking prices and notify you when it gets to a reasonable price. I’ll also add it to the tracking graphs, so you can get a glimpse of how the price changes over time. \
> If you choose to book, let me know when, and i’ll lock you in on the various graphs

### What is Trusted Traveler Programs and why should I care

{% hint style="warning" %}
Global Entry application processing times are extremly high right now, so there is a very real possiblity that it could not be ready by LTX, even more so if you don't currently posses a valid US passport. You have been warned
{% endhint %}

> Trusted Traveler Programs are programs that if enrolled allow you to use the TSA PreCheck line at your local airports. There’s only two that matter for us and that is TSA Precheck and Global Entry. I suggest TSA Precheck for almost everyone, but some people _cough Frame cough_ want to explore both so fine

### What is the "Party Plane"

> The party plane is a meme that turned into reality. It just so happened that everyones flights could be on the same airline and as such got dubbed the party plane. if was going to be on american from DFW to YVR but it has since been changed to Delta from SLC to YVR (because apparently delta loves SLC for some reason and not at all because thats my departing airport. That would be crazy)&#x20;

## Hotels

### Where are we staying

> No idea, will be updated closer to departure

### Who is staying where?
